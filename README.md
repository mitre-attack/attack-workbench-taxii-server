# ATT&CK Workbench TAXII Server

The ATT&CK Workbench TAXII server is a Node.js server designed to serve STIX 2.1 content through a
[TAXII 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/csprd02/taxii-v2.1-csprd02.html) compliant REST API. It
runs as part of the overarching [ATT&CK Workbench project](https://medium.com/mitre-engenuity/att-ck-workbench-a-tool-for-extending-att-ck-e1718cbfe0ef).
The ATT&CK Workbench is an application allowing users to **explore**, **create**, **annotate**, and **share** extensions
of the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base.

The following resources provide supporting documentation about the TAXII protocol and use cases:
- [Introduction to TAXII](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro.html)
- [TAXII 2.1 Specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html)
- [OASIS Open TAXII Resources](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/resources.html#taxii-21-specification)
<!-- TODO: this will need to change when the official TAXII 2.1 server is hosted and docs are migrated to attack-workbench-data -->
<!-- [accessing ATT&CK data via TAXII](https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md#access-from-the-attck-taxii-server) -->

The ATT&CK Workbench application requires additional components for full operation. 
The [ATT&CK Workbench Frontend](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend) 
repository contains the full documentation of the scope and function of the project. See the [install and run](#install-and-run) 
instructions for more details about setting up the entire project.

## API Roots

This application exposes contents of the local ATT&CK Workbench knowledge base through TAXII 2.1 [Collections](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107500). 
Currently, one [API Root](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107498) is used to 
logically group the available STIX collections and their associated endpoints. Users can see which API roots are available
through the server's [discovery endpoint](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_q0a03pfr5x7n) (`/taxii2/`).

### Workbench Collections

The collections API root (`{api-root}/collections/`) provides access to Workbench data segregated by 
[Workbench collection](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend/blob/master/docs/collections.md). 
Each version of each collection within the knowledge base, including both locally-created and imported collections, is 
made available through this API Root. In addition, the most recent version of each collection is made available under a 
static ID alias such that when a new version is created/imported the corresponding TAXII endpoint does not change. The 
following diagram demonstrates this feature:

```
TAXII Collection ID                            Workbench Collection

## TAXII Server Documentation
The application uses Swagger UI module to dynamically document the available REST API endpoints. The Swagger report can 
be accessed at the path: `/api-docs`.

The [docs](/docs/README.md) folder contains additional documentation about using the TAXII Server:
- [USAGE](/docs/USAGE.md): Includes advanced details and instructions for setting up the TAXII Server.
- [CONTRIBUTING](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md): information about how to contribute to this project.

## Install and run

By default, the TAXII Server is not required to use the ATT&CK Workbench, but the ATT&CK Workbench is required to use 
the TAXII server. The ATT&CK Workbench consists of the following software components:

- [ATT&CK Workbench Frontend](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend): The front-end user interface for the ATT&CK Workbench tool, and the primary interface through which the knowledge base is accessed.
- [ATT&CK Workbench REST API](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api): REST API service for storing, querying and editing ATT&CK objects.
- [ATT&CK Workbench Collection Manager](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-collection-manager): REST API service for managing collections, collection indexes, and collection subscriptions. The collection manager is **not** required to be installed to use the ATT&CK Workbench, but is **highly recommended**.

Each of the aforementioned repositories contains their own respective deployment instructions. However, the easiest way
to deploy the entire ATT&CK Workbench is via the [Docker Compose](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend/blob/master/docs/docker-compose.md) contained in the front-end repository.

### Docker
#### Container Registry
The ATT&CK Workbench TAXII server is packaged as a Docker image in the GitHub Container registry:
```shell
$ docker pull ghcr.io/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server:latest
```

#### Build from source

If you wish to build a Docker image from source, a [shell script](./run.sh) is provided to ease the process. It handles
the following:
- loading environment variables from a specified dotenv file
- building a Docker image from source
- creating and starting a container instance

The script requires two environment variables:
- `TAXII_ENV`: used to determine the name of the dotenv configuration file
- `TAXII_APP_PORT`: used in the `docker run` command to expose the desired port
```shell
$ export TAXII_ENV=prod | dev | local
$ export TAXII_APP_PORT=443
$ ./run.sh
```
### Manual Installation

#### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version `14.20.0` or greater
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version must support `AsyncLocalStorage`
 
#### Installation

##### Step 1. Clone the git repository

```
git clone git@github.com:mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server.git
cd attack-workbench-taxii-server
```

##### Step 2. Install the dependencies

The ATT&CK Workbench TAXII Server installs all dependencies within the project.
It doesn't depend on the global installation of any modules.

```
npm install
```

##### Step 3. Configure the system

The app is configured using environment variables loaded from a dotenv file. A template is provided for your convenience. 
See the [USAGE](./docs/USAGE.md#environment-variables) document for a list of supported environment variables and usage 
descriptions. 

Store the dotenv file in the root `config/` directory, and ensure that the `TAXII_ENV` environment variable reflects the 
dotenv file name. `TAXII_ENV` determines the name of the environment variable which gets loaded by the server. For example:
- If `TAXII_ENV` is equal to `dev`, then the server attempts to load `config/dev.env`.
- If `TAXII_ENV` is equal to `prod`, then the server attempts to load `config/prod.env`.

Example:
```shell
$ export TAXII_ENV=dev
$ cp config/template.env config/${TAXII_ENV}.env
$ # modify the dev.env file 
$ # done!
```
##### Step 4. Run the app

To run the production-mode server with Swagger enabled:
```shell
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```
To run the server with hot-reload enabled (such that the server automatically reloads when you make a change to a file):
```shell
$ npm run start:dev
```
